This plugin lets you broadcast to all GVIM windows (or all other windows except current).  Especially handy for someone who prefers to open each file in a separate window instead of a separate buffer.  Lots of things possible, for example:

Globally replace text across all GVIM windows:
   :Bcast :%s/oldtext/newtext/g<CR>

Exit all other opened GVIM windows:
   :Bcast0 :q<CR>
